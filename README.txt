 
 2. Describe the sequence data you plan to use by specifying:* What the sequences are representing and where they come from.* Whether there is one sequence per case or multichannel sequences? In case of multichannel sequences, specify to the following points for each channel.* The nature of the sequences (Categorical? Chronological? State or event sequences? ...,)* The alphabet (list of symbols in the sequences).– Is there a natural order of the symbols (ordinal variable)?* Size of the alphabet– If larger than 15, propose category mergings to reduce the size.– In case of numerical sequences, suggest a way to discretize the values into 15 classes or less.* Number of sequences.* Maximum and minimum sequence lengths.* The kind of knowledge you expect to extract from your sequences. What are you primarily interested in: sequencing, timing, duration, quantum?
